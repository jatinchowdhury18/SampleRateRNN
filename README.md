# Sample Rate Agnostic Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains example code for creating recurrent
neural networks that can be used at any sample rate. The network
is implemented using the [RTNeural](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/RTNeural) 
inferencing library. For more information, see the [Medium article]()
describing how these networks work.
